                A very warm welcome to my Food blog. My name is Fahim, better known as cooking hero. I’m 27 years old
                and was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed course on advance cooking from hero and worked ad Main
                Chef at Le Méridien Dhaka. Cooking is fun because it's a creative experience. I like to search, explore
                and experiment new recipes all the time. And it is very relaxing: while listening to some nice music,
                the whole big kitchen to myself, just me and lots of ingredients to work with. Well this is the way I
                like to imagine my cooking experiences.

            <p>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8-inch square pan. In a large
                saucepan, melt 1/2 cup butter. Remove from heat, and stir in sugar, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat
                in 1/3 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup flour, salt, and baking powder. Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake in

            <p>
                Heat olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper,
                to taste. Add chicken to the stockpot and cook until golden, about 2-3 minutes; set aside.

            <h2>
                Beef Steak
            </h2>
            <p>
                Mix 1 tablespoon butter with parsley, garlic and soy sauce. Mix 1 tablespoon butter with parsley, garlic
                and soy sauce. Cut outer edge of fat on steaks (except tenderloin steaks) diagonally at 1-inch intervals
                with a sharp knife. Do not cut into the meat because it will allow the juices to cook out and the beef
                will become dry.
